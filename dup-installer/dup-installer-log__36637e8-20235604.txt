INSTALLER ERROR:
A wp-config.php already exists in this location.  This error prevents users from accidentally overwriting a WordPress site or trying to install on top of an existing one.  Extracting an archive on an existing site will overwrite existing files and intermix files causing site incompatibility issues.

  It is highly recommended to place the installer and archive in an empty directory. If you have already manually extracted the archive file that is associated with this installer then choose option #1 below; other-wise consider the other options: Click &gt; Try Again &gt; Options &gt; choose "Manual Archive Extraction".Empty the directory except for the archive.zip/daf and installer.php and try again.Advanced users only can remove the existing wp-config.php file and try again.
